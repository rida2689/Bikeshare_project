## Explore US Bikeshare Data

Date created: 28th May 2020

### Description
I compared Bikeshare usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

I used descriptive statistics to learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to provide the following information:

1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

2) Popular stations and trip

3) Trip duration

4) User information
  
### Files used
In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

I was provided data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year

### Getting Started
I used python to take in raw input to create an interactive environment to filter the data for a dataset to analyse.

In order to start the environment, run 'python bikeshare.py' on terminal. Three questions will be asked:

  - Which city would you like to look at?
  
  - Which month would you like to analyse?
  
  - Which day of the week would you like to analyse?

### Credits
I would like to thank the contributers of Stack overflow. During the time of working on this project, I relied on questions and comments to correct issues.
